Tasks:

- Fine tune the camera movement:
    - Slow down at lower altitudes
    - Don't intersect terrain
    - maybe a better forwards control

- Background task:
    - Determine distance to tile
    - determine vertical and horizontal angles the tile presents, and thus an estimated area.
    - determine an angle to the tile based from the camera position and direction.
    
    - Create a score of draw priority and resolution.
