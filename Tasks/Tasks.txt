Vision:
=======
A 3D world to explore, and visualise customer data.

Target of current iteration:
============================
Deliver the core functionality and demonstrate developing areas through tech-demo windows.
- Dynamically loading earth - reducing VRAM burden
- 2D selectable elements
- Windows of entity details
- Better 3D model loading and management (consistency).
- Management of linked and unlinked elements.

Functional Goal:
- Tech demo presentation.
- Outline next version of the app - validate tech demos.



App Outline
===========
- 3D Globe - Dynamically loading
    - Demos smooth tile loading, minimum VRAM burden
    - New LOD levels, load textures later.
    - New decimated mesh, geometry saved in database.

- Camera controls
    - World view
    - Chase cam

- Entity Data
    - List entities
    - Show pos/speed
    - Show Element summary

- Control
    - Settings
    - Network
    - CLI


Immeditate Task:
================

- Draw the tile edges



Short Term Todo List:
=====================

- Create a record of visibility/child tile control metrics, updated in background as used in _process to trigger the creation of new tiles.

- Fine tune the camera movement:
    - Slow down at lower altitudes
    - Don't intersect terrain
    - maybe a better forwards control

- Background task:
    - Determine distance to tile
    - determine vertical and horizontal angles the tile presents, and thus an estimated area.
    - determine an angle to the tile based from the camera position and direction.

    - Create a distance-resolution score of draw priority and resolution, that we can judge against. ie (anything above 50, add the child tiles or next LOD)
`

- At least add and display a child
    - Make sure the core mechanics of it are working okay



Tasks:
======

3D Models:
    - Get the loading running again
        - Improve the scaling, maybe in a loader scene with rulers etc.
        - Load dummy elements to check for awkward presentatino cases.

Networking:
    - Get a dummy program from KoreSim injecting JSON messages
    - Network config window

- Display entities
    - New scene/window to show loaded entities and basic movement attributes.

Bugs:
=====

Tile Longitude:
- Something wrong with the longitude calculations of a tile.



Future Ideas:
=============
- OSM Data:

Comparable Apps/Frameworks:
===========================
- Google Maps

- Google Earth

- KDE Marble
    https://marble.kde.org/

- Caesium
    Expansive 3D world framework and community
